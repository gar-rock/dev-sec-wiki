Python virtual enviornments have many use cases for developing. 
Many of the benefits come from version control between the host development machine and the target deployment environment. 

Imagine that you are running multiple scripts on the same machine, which require different versions of python modules.
ie. 
my_script_1.py -> requires requests<2.20.0
my_script_2.py -> requires requests>=2.30.0

For whatever reason you have to run two seperate version on the same host.. This simply does not work without virtual environments, or venv for short. 

A venv is typically tied to a working directory. 
ie.

    mainy.py
    my_data.json
    venv

The venv is a directory that contains all of the necessary binaries to run
