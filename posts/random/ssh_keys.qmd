# Intro
As a developer you will typically use SSH keys for pushing/pulling code on a remote repo.
You will need to generate a public and private key locally on your machine, and then upload your public key to your repo settings.
Typically you will sign your private key (with a unique password) that only you know. 



# Useful Information
You can generate a new SSH key on your local linux machine with this command.

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`


If you have multiple Keys to use for various remote repos... for example Github and GitLab, or maybe one for your company's GitHub, and another for your private GitHub, you 
can update the config file in the `.ssh` directory to point to various keys. 

1. Create the config file is it doesn't exist
`touch ~/.ssh/config`

2. Edit the file
`nano ~/.ssh/config`

3. Here is an example for when you might have 3 accounts
```
# github account
Host github.com
HostName github.com
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myaccount_github

# gitlab account
Host gitlab.com
HostName gitlab.com
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myaccount_gitlab

# gitlab company account
Host gitlab.my_company.com
HostName gitlab.my_company.com
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mycompanyaccount_gitlab
```
