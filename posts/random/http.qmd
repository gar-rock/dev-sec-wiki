# Intro
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that handles the transmitting and recieving of data between clients and servers on the World Wide Web. 
Think of it as the rules of the web road, governing how data is sent, what format it must be in, and what to do if data is lost or doesn't exist.
Originally it was used for delivering requested media and HTML documents from server to client/browser. 
Today, since the transition from HTTP/0.9 (released in 1991) to HTTP/3 (introduced in June 2022), it has expanded to support many features that increases reliability, speed, and security. 

### Here is a timeline of features that were added to each version

#### **HTTP/0.9** (1991)
-
- Single line **GET** with html document 

    **Request**  

        
        GET /mypage.html
        

    **Response** 
    
        
        <html>
            A very simple HTML page
        </html>
        

#### **HTTP/1.0** (1996) [RFC1945](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945) - Refers to both 0.9 and 1.0
-
- Single line **GET** with html document and version
- Status code in response
- Headers were introduced for Request and Response
- Documents other than HTML could be passed with the Content-Type header
    
    **Request**

        GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.0
        User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)
        

    **Response**

        200 OK
        Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
        Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
        Content-Type: text/html
        <HTML>
        A page with an image
        <IMG SRC="/myimage.gif">
        </HTML>
        
    Followed by a second request for the image "myimage.gif"

    **Request**

        GET /myimage.gif HTTP/1.0
        User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)
        
    **Response**
        
        200 OK
        Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:32 GMT
        Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
        Content-Type: text/gif
        (image content)
    
    * Additional Method Requests such as PUT, POST, DELETE, LINK, UNLINK were introduced but not widely accepted.

#### **HTTP/1.1** (1997) [RFC2068](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068#section-9.5)
-
- The official standardized HTTP protocol
- Connections could be reused, and data chunked, whihc improved latency
- Content negotiation and additional caching features improved browser speed
- Host header was added, which allowed for server collocation on different domains

    * With the stability provided in HTTP/1.1 companies such as NetScape and Microsoft began to improve upon various aspects of the protocol
    * Additional features included encryption through SSL from Netscape
    * same-origin policy was adopted, along with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Content Security Policy (CSP)
  
#### **HTTP/2** (1997) [7540](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540)
-
- The next official update to HTTP, which enabled better network efficiency, reduce latency
- Includes header compression on duplicate calls
- Includes multiplexing on the same connections
- Keeps HTTP/1.1 semantics and messages syntax
- largely prioneered by Google
